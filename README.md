## Advent of Code 2020 

I will share my solutions for hopefully each day of this years [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

### Organization

Instead of opening up a new project for each day, I have one main class containing 
the solution output for all days. 

Each individual day's implementation can then be found in their respective packages. 
I will try to write tests as well but don't take that for granted :D
